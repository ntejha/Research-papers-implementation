# AI Research Paper Implementations

Welcome to my repository of AI research paper implementations. This project aims to provide open-source, from-scratch code implementations of various AI architectures. The initial focus is on the GPT architecture, and I will continue to add new implementations from different research papers over time.

## Introduction

The goal of this repository is to make the knowledge and implementation of AI research papers accessible to everyone. Whether you are a student, researcher, or enthusiast, you can learn and build upon these implementations. By providing these codes, I hope to foster a collaborative learning environment and accelerate the adoption of AI technologies.

## Implemented Papers

### GPT Architecture

The Generative Pre-trained Transformer (GPT) is a state-of-the-art language model that has shown remarkable performance in various natural language processing tasks. This implementation includes:

- **Paper**: [Attention is All You Need](https://arxiv.org/abs/1706.03762)

## Issues and Feedback

If you find any issues or have any feedback, please label an issue in the repository. This helps me learn and improve the implementations.
